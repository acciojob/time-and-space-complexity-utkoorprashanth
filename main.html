	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time compexity is a way to represent how efficient an algorithm is.It helps in evaluating how the computation time increase with input size.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in terms of the input size.A coomon example of space complexity is O(n).</p>
